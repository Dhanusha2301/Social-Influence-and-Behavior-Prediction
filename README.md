# Social-Influence-and-Behavior-Prediction
This project predicts how behaviors and opinions spread in social networks by combining Graph Neural Networks (GraphSAGE and GAT) with causal inference techniques. It generates node embeddings to capture structural and feature information, while causal analysis identifies true influencers, separating genuine impact from mere correlation.
